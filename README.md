## User Stories
- As a creator, I want to able to have users guess words based on difficulty , so that there is a difficulty setting easy medium and hard.
- As a creator, I want limit the amount of incorrect guesses , so that the game will end if the user depletes the allot amount of chances.
- As a creator, I want the user to be able to guess the word if they know the correct answer
- As a creator , I want display the letters on the window, so that the user knows their options.
- As a user, I want have the lives displayed, so that i know how many incorrect guess i have.

## Future Add-ons
- Third party Api to render random image related to category
- Auto filler function added to hint button to fill in A hidden space randomly

## Hurdles
- Working through how I needed to pass my event listner an argument so that it was able to check that the argument against the hidden word ex:

- Having to re-evaulate my appoarch so my code logic made sense to someone reading my code
- Learning to think through my code ex: use dev tools to de-bug, completed smaller parts of the larger problem not tryign to solve the bigger problem
- Making guesstimate mobile friendly was a big deal to me because most people play games on they phones or tablets
---
## Take aways
- Remember to use best practices. "I'm not re-creating the wheel"
- Write code thats easily readable 
- Knowing what tools I have was the biggest take away, becoming familair with with array and string methods to manipulate my data was so key in my learning during this project
- Having code that can easily be reusable for futurre projects and can be scaled up if needed or scaled down
