- Working through how I needed to pass my event listner an argument so that it was able to check that the argument against the hidden word ex:

- Having to re-evaulate my appoarch so my code logic made sense to someone readin my code
- Learning to think through my code ex: use dev tools to de-bug, completed smaller parts of the larger problem not tryign to solve the bigger problem
- Laving code that can easily be reusable for futurre projects and can be scaled up if needed or scaled down
- Making guesstimate mobile friendly was a big deal to me because most people play games on they phones or tablets

## Take aways
- Use best practices im not re-creating the wheel
- Write code thats easily readable so i can read it easily 
- Knowing what tools i have was the biggest take away, becoming familair with with array and string methods to manipulate my data was so key in my learning during this project
